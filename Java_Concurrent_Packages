java concurnecy courtsey Doug Lea:

A)Java concurrency advantages (Performance,relaibility,maintainable):
1)exploiting multiple cores
2)illusion of parallelism on single core machines by acuiring and releasing cpu at runtime
3)supports multithreading
4)provides thread safe synchronisation
5)Reduced time to develop for even a complex thread program

B) Following are the JAVA packages that support concurrent programming
o Java.util.concurrent
o Java.util.concurrent.atomic
o Java.util.concurrent.locks
o Java.lang.Threads

Executor Framework:
-> provides abstraction for task execution
-> supports 'launching' new tasks
